# PyManille

This is a basic implementation of the Manille card game in Python.

There is a single human player and 3 automated AI players. The AI is very rudimentary!

Details on the Manille card game and rules can be foune on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manille

## Dependencies
There is a text based version which is just manille.py which will run stand alone.

There is a GUI version which makes use of Qt for the GUI and which makes use of GreyWyvern's Playing Card Set which came from qt-apps.org. The files are included in this repository with some minor modifications, but giving as much credit to Gery Wyvern as possible.


## Running
To run the text based version:

> python manille.py

To run the GUI version:

> python manilleGUI.py
